analysis and design of acoustic devices

## Introduction

This repository contains some notes and applications about how to analysis and design of acoustic devices, especially for surface acoustic wave (SAW) and thin film bulk acoustic resonator (FBAR) devices.

## Installation

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Description

* `/docs` includes technical notes, please open the `md` files with [typora](https://www.typora.io) to display equations correctly.

* `impulse.py` use **impulse model design method** to design the SAW delay line device
